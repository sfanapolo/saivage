## 1. System Overview

Saivage v2 is an **autonomous software engineering system** that takes high-level project objectives and executes them through a hierarchy of specialized LLM agents. It manages its own planning, task decomposition, code generation, research, quality assurance, and user communication — running continuously until the objectives are met or the user redirects.

### 1.1 Design Principles

- **Hierarchical delegation**: a chain of command (Planner → Manager → Workers) where each level has well-scoped responsibility and clear contracts.
- **Disk is the source of truth**: all durable state lives on disk as JSON documents. LLM conversations are transient working memory — losing them is always recoverable.
- **Tool-call invocation**: agents communicate exclusively through LLM tool calls. A parent calls a child as a tool, suspends, receives the result when the child finishes. No message queues, no shared memory.
- **Convention over enforcement**: all agents (except Chat) have full filesystem access. Territorial conventions (Coder writes project code, Researcher writes under `research/`) prevent collisions without runtime permission checks.
- **Crash recoverability**: the system can restart at any point and reconstruct its state from disk.
- **Progressive escalation**: failures cascade upward (Worker → Manager → Planner → User) with each level having the opportunity to retry, remediate, or replan.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Runtime Core

The Runtime Core is the central orchestration engine. It is a **singleton** within the Node.js process and manages the lifecycle of every agent conversation.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Agent lifecycle management**: spawn, suspend, resume, and terminate agent LLM conversations.
- **Tool-call dispatch**: intercept agent-dispatch tool calls (`run_manager`, `run_coder`, etc.), suspend the parent, spawn the child, and inject the child's result back into the parent's conversation when done.
- **Abort handling**: detect urgent user notes, terminate the active agent chain bottom-up, clean the working tree (`git checkout -- .` resets tracked modified files; untracked files are left for the rollback stage), and resume the Planner with the abort context.
- **Context compaction**: track token usage per conversation, trigger compaction when usage exceeds the threshold (default 80%), produce a summary message that replaces the conversation history.
- **Periodic self-check**: inject a progress-assessment prompt after every N tool-call rounds to catch infinite loops.
- **Crash recovery**: on startup, detect stale state from a previous crash, reconstruct the execution position from disk, and restart the Planner.

**Key technical details:**
- Runs on the **Node.js single-threaded event loop**. Concurrency is achieved through async I/O — LLM calls, MCP tool calls, and channel messages are all non-blocking.
- Parent agents are suspended in-memory (full message history + pending tool-call IDs). On crash, this is lost, but disk state is authoritative.
- The Dispatcher supports **resume-on-each** for parallel child dispatch: when the Manager issues both `run_coder()` and `run_researcher()` in one LLM response, both children run concurrently and the Manager resumes independently as each returns. The runtime enforces a maximum of **1 Coder + 1 Researcher** concurrently — excess dispatch calls of the same type are rejected with an error result.

See [04-RUNTIME-DETAILS.md](04-RUNTIME-DETAILS.md) for full suspend/resume mechanics, compaction timing, self-check injection, and failure handling.

### 2.2 Agent System

Six specialized agents, each an LLM conversation with a system prompt, a set of available tools, and a well-defined contract for inputs and outputs.

        CD["Coder<br/>one task"]
        RS["Researcher<br/>one task"]
        IN["Inspector<br/>one request"]
    end
    subgraph "Independent"

    end

    CH -.->|"create_note(content, permanent?, urgent?)"| PL
```

#### Planner
- **Lifetime**: project lifetime (never terminates until objectives are met).
- **Responsibilities**: generate the initial multi-stage plan from project objectives, dispatch stages to the Manager one at a time, process stage results (completed/failed/escalated/aborted), revise the plan adaptively, process user notes, dispatch the Inspector for retrospectives.
- **Tools**: Plan MCP service (full read/write), `run_manager()`, `run_inspector()`, filesystem (read), git (commit `.saivage/` state).
- **State management**: the plan MCP service is the authoritative state store. After compaction, the Planner reconstructs strategic context via `plan_get()` + `plan_get_history()`.

#### Manager
- **Lifetime**: one stage (spawned by Planner, terminates on completion/escalation/abort).
- **Responsibilities**: decompose a stage into an ordered task list, dispatch tasks to Coder/Researcher, process task reports, handle failures (retry with modified description, remediate, escalate), write stage summary.
- **Tools**: `run_coder()`, `run_researcher()`, filesystem (read/write tasks and summaries), git (commit `.saivage/stages/`).
- **Parallel dispatch**: can issue one Coder + one Researcher task concurrently when tasks are independent. Resumes as each returns.
- **Failure handling**: on task failure, increments `task.attempt`, appends failure context to description, retries. If `attempt >= max_attempts`, escalates. If a dependency task fails, cascades failure to all dependents.

#### Coder
- **Lifetime**: one task (spawned by Manager).
- **Responsibilities**: execute coding/testing/documentation tasks, write code, run tests, commit changes, produce a TaskReport with checklist results.
- **Tools**: filesystem (read/write), shell (run commands/tests), git (commit own files), web (read docs), memory, index.
- **Territory**: project source code. Commits project files + task report.

#### Researcher
- **Lifetime**: one task (spawned by Manager).
- **Responsibilities**: gather information from external sources, organize findings under `research/`, produce a TaskReport.
- **Tools**: same as Coder.
- **Territory**: `research/` directory. Writes under `research/` by convention.

#### Inspector
- **Lifetime**: one investigation (spawned by Planner or Chat).
- **Responsibilities**: deep analysis of project state — code quality, test coverage, architecture review, performance — producing an InspectionReport with findings and recommendations.
- **Tools**: filesystem (read/write), shell (run analysis), git, web.
- **Three storage tiers**: ephemeral workspace (`tmp/inspector-workspace/<report-id>/`), persistent reports (`inspections/`), persistent tools (`tools/inspector/`). Can promote useful tools from scratch to persistent.
- **Serialized**: only one Inspector runs at a time (FIFO queue if Planner and Chat both request simultaneously).

#### Chat
- **Lifetime**: per channel, runs independently of the execution hierarchy.
- **Responsibilities**: answer user queries about project state, relay user direction to the Planner via notes, dispatch Inspector on user request, push notifications for system events.
- **Tools**: Plan MCP (read-only), filesystem (read-only), `run_inspector()`, `create_note(content, permanent?, urgent?)`.
- **Channels**: Telegram (long-polling) and Web UI (WebSocket). One Chat agent instance per channel.
- **Does not block** the execution pipeline. Cannot directly modify project code or plan state — its only write operations are creating user notes and dispatching the Inspector.

Full agent behaviors, inputs, outputs, and trigger events are specified in [00-AGENT-SYSTEM.md](00-AGENT-SYSTEM.md).

### 2.3 LLM Provider Router

The Provider Router manages all LLM API communication. It is a **singleton** reused from v1.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Model selection**: for each agent role, select the model from configuration. Precedence: `ProjectConfig.model_overrides[role]` → `GlobalConfig.providers[name].models[role]` → most capable available.
- **Retry with backoff**: all retryable errors (HTTP 429, 5xx, timeouts) are retried with exponential backoff (1s→60s, ±20% jitter). Retries are bounded by a maximum retry duration per request (default: 10 minutes). If exceeded, the error is surfaced as an agent failure. Provider failover may resolve the issue before the timeout.
- **Provider failover**: if a provider fails 5+ consecutive times within 2 minutes, switch to the configured failover provider. Try the primary again on the next agent invocation.
- **Request timeout**: configurable per provider (default: 120s).

**Non-retryable errors** (surfaced as agent failure): HTTP 400 (bad request), HTTP 401/403 (auth failure), context window exceeded.

See [04-RUNTIME-DETAILS.md](04-RUNTIME-DETAILS.md) §2 for retry details and invalid tool-call handling.

### 2.4 MCP Service Runtime

The MCP Service Runtime manages the lifecycle of MCP service child processes. It is a **singleton** reused from v1.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Lazy startup**: services are started on first tool call, not at boot.
- **Health monitoring**: periodic health checks. Dead services are restarted automatically.
- **Idle shutdown**: services unused for a configurable period are stopped to free resources.
- **Crash recovery**: tracks crash count per service. Restarts on next tool call.
- **In-process services**: the agent-dispatch tools (`run_manager`, `run_coder`, etc.) are registered as in-process handlers — no subprocess overhead.
- **Tool routing**: `callTool(service, tool, args)` routes to the correct service, starting it if needed.

**Services available:** filesystem, shell, git, web, plan, skills, memory, index. Services communicate via stdio using the MCP SDK protocol. Full tool schemas and access matrix in [05-MCP-SERVICES.md](05-MCP-SERVICES.md).

### 2.5 Event Bus & Notification System

An in-process pub/sub bus that connects runtime events to user-facing channels.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Event publishing**: the runtime publishes events when significant things happen (stage completed, task failed, escalation, Inspector report ready, plan updated).
- **Chat subscription**: each Chat agent subscribes on startup. When an event arrives, the Chat agent checks the user's notification filters (min_severity, category whitelist) and formats a concise push message.
- **Channel delivery**: Telegram via bot API `sendMessage`, Web via WebSocket push.
- **Offline buffering**: if a channel is disconnected, buffer up to 100 events. On overflow, drop oldest with a summary message. Deliver buffered events on reconnection.

**Event types:**

| Event | Published when | Severity |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| `stage_completed` | Manager returns success | info |
| `stage_failed` | Manager fails unrecoverably (runtime error, not escalation) | error |
| `escalation` | Manager escalates to Planner | warning |
| `task_failed` | Worker returns failure | warning |
| `inspector_complete` | Inspector returns report | info |
| `plan_updated` | Planner modifies the plan | info |

### 2.6 Skill System

Skills inject project-specific knowledge into agent contexts at invocation time.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Trigger matching**: when an agent is invoked, the Skill Loader evaluates all skills against the agent's metadata (task/stage description, tool list, file paths, tags, agent type). Trigger types: `keyword:<word>` (case-insensitive substring), `tool:<name>` (exact match), `path:<glob>` (minimatch), `tag:<label>` (exact), `agent:<type>` (exact).
- **Target filtering**: skills with `target_agents` are only loaded for matching agent types.
- **Ranking**: matched skills are ranked by trigger match count (descending), then `updated_at` (most recent first).
- **Budget**: top N skills loaded per invocation (configurable, default 5).
- **Injection format**: each loaded skill is prepended to the context as a system message section: `--- SKILL: <name> ---\n<content>\n---`.

**Discovery paths** (in precedence order):
1. `<SAIVAGE_ROOT>/skills/` — builtin skills shipped with Saivage
2. `~/.saivage/skills/` — user global skills
3. `<PROJECT>/.saivage/skills/` — project-specific skills (highest precedence)

**Generation**: the Manager can schedule skill-creation tasks when it detects reusable patterns. The Coder creates the `.md` file and updates `skills/index.json`.

### 2.7 Document Store

A generic CRUD layer for all JSON documents on disk.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Atomic writes**: every write goes to a `.tmp` file first, then is renamed into place. No partial writes on crash.
- **Schema validation**: every document is validated against its Zod schema before write. Invalid data is rejected.
- **CRUD operations**: `read<T>(path)`, `write<T>(path, data)`, `append<T>(path, item)`, `list(dir)`, `delete(path)`.
- **Project context**: bundles project root, config, and resolved paths for all downstream components.

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Storage Layout

All project state lives inside `<project>/.saivage/`. Global config is at `~/.saivage/`.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Project Directory"
        subgraph "Git-Tracked (.saivage/)"
            CONF["config.json<br/><i>ProjectConfig</i>"]
            PLAN["plan.json<br/><i>Active plan (via MCP)</i>"]
            HIST["plan-history.json<br/><i>Terminal stages</i>"]
            NOTES["notes/<br/><i>User → Planner</i>"]

            TOOLS["tools/inspector/<br/><i>Persistent analysis tools</i>"]
        end
        subgraph "Gitignored (.saivage/tmp/)"
            RUNTIME["state/runtime.json<br/><i>Crash recovery</i>"]
            IWRK["inspector-workspace/<br/><i>Scratch space</i>"]
            CHATS["chats/&lt;channel&gt;/<br/><i>Dialogue logs</i>"]
            WORK["work/<br/><i>Agent scratch</i>"]
        end
        SRC["(project source code)"]
    end

    subgraph "Global (~/.saivage/)"
        GCONF["config.json<br/><i>LLM creds, Telegram token</i>"]
        AUTH["auth/<br/><i>Provider tokens</i>"]
        REG["registry.json<br/><i>MCP service registry</i>"]
        GSKILLS["skills/<br/><i>User global skills</i>"]
        MEMDB["data/memory.db<br/><i>Long-term memory (SQLite)</i>"]
        IDXDB["data/index.db<br/><i>Full-text index (SQLite)</i>"]
    end
```

### 3.2 Data Sovereignty Rules

Each data domain has a single owner and a defined access pattern:

| Data | Owner | Written by | Read by | Storage |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `plan.json`, `plan-history.json` | Plan MCP service | Planner (via MCP tools) | Planner, Chat | Git-tracked |
| `stages/<id>/tasks.json` | Manager | Manager | Manager, Planner (via summary) | Git-tracked |
| `stages/<id>/summary.json` | Manager | Manager | Planner | Git-tracked |
| `stages/<id>/reports/<id>.json` | Worker | Coder/Researcher | Manager | Git-tracked |
| `notes/<id>.json` | Chat | Chat (via `create_note`); Runtime (acknowledgment, cleanup) | Planner (via runtime injection) | Git-tracked |
| `inspections/<id>.json` | Inspector | Inspector | Planner, Chat | Git-tracked |
| `research/<topic>/` | Researcher | Researcher | Any agent | Git-tracked |
| `skills/` | Coder | Coder (when tasked) | All agents (via loader) | Git-tracked |
| `tools/inspector/` | Inspector | Inspector | Inspector | Git-tracked |
| `tmp/state/runtime.json` | Runtime | Runtime Core | Runtime (recovery) | Gitignored |
| `tmp/chats/` | Chat | Chat | Chat | Gitignored |
| Project source code | Coder | Coder | Any agent | Git-tracked |
| Git history | Git MCP | All agents (via MCP) | All agents | Git |

**Key rules:**
- No agent reads or writes `plan.json` or `plan-history.json` directly — all access goes through the Plan MCP service.
- No agent calls `git` CLI directly — all git operations go through the Git MCP service.
- Conversations are ephemeral. Disk is the source of truth. On crash, all conversations are lost and reconstructed from files.

## 4. Execution Model

### 4.1 Main Execution Loop

The system runs as a **nested tool-call chain**. The Planner is the top-level agent; all others are children invoked as tools.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant RT as Runtime
    participant PL as Planner
    participant PM as Plan MCP
    participant MG as Manager
    participant CD as Coder
    participant RS as Researcher

    RT->>PL: Start (project objectives)
    PL->>PM: plan_init(stages)
    
    loop For each stage
        PL->>PM: plan_set_current(stage_id)
        PL->>MG: run_manager(stage)
        Note over PL: Suspended
        
        MG->>MG: Read references, decompose into tasks
        MG->>MG: Write tasks.json
        
        loop For each task batch
            par Independent tasks
                MG->>CD: run_coder(task_a)
                Note over MG: Suspended
            and
                MG->>RS: run_researcher(task_b)
            end
            CD-->>MG: TaskReport
            Note over MG: Resumed
            RS-->>MG: TaskReport
            Note over MG: Resumed
            MG->>MG: Update tasks.json
        end
        
        MG->>MG: Write summary.json
        MG-->>PL: StageSummary
        Note over PL: Resumed
        
        PL->>PM: plan_complete_stage(stage_id, ...)
        PL->>PM: plan_set_stages(...) [if revised]
        PL->>PM: plan_commit("stage completed")
    end
```

### 4.2 Abort & Replanning

When the user sends an urgent note, the runtime aborts the active agent chain and returns control to the Planner.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant CH as Chat
    participant RT as Runtime
    participant CD as Coder
    participant MG as Manager
    participant PL as Planner

    U->>CH: "Stop, change direction"
    CH->>CH: create_note(content, urgent=true)
    CH-->>U: "Aborting current work..."
    
    RT->>RT: Detect urgent note
    RT->>CD: Terminate
    RT->>RT: git checkout -- .
    RT->>MG: Inject abort signal
    MG->>MG: Write partial StageSummary (aborted)
    MG-->>PL: StageSummary (result: "aborted")
    
    Note over PL: Resumed with urgent note
    PL->>PL: Create rollback stage + new stages
    PL->>MG: run_manager(rollback_stage)
    Note over PL: Normal execution resumes
```

### 4.3 Error Escalation

Failures cascade upward through the hierarchy, with each level having the opportunity to handle them.

```mermaid
graph BT
    CD["Coder/Researcher<br/><i>Task failure</i>"] -->|"TaskReport (failed)"| MG
    MG["Manager<br/><i>Retry / Remediate / Escalate</i>"] -->|"StageSummary (escalated)"| PL
    PL["Planner<br/><i>Replan / Schedule retrospective</i>"] -->|"Notification"| CH
    CH["Chat<br/><i>Notify user</i>"] -->|"Push message"| U["User"]
    
    MG -->|"Retry (modify description,<br/>increment attempt)"| CD
    PL -->|"Revised stage"| MG
    PL -->|"run_inspector"| IN["Inspector<br/><i>Retrospective</i>"]
```

### 4.4 User Interaction

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant CH as Chat
    participant PM as Plan MCP
    participant IN as Inspector
    participant PL as Planner

    Note over U,PL: Status Query
    U->>CH: "What's happening?"
    CH->>PM: plan_get()
    PM-->>CH: Plan state
    CH-->>U: "Stage 3/7: Building auth module..."

    Note over U,PL: Direction
    U->>CH: "Focus on tests first"
    CH->>CH: create_note("Focus on tests first")
    CH-->>U: "Note created, Planner will process on next resume"

    Note over U,PL: Investigation
    U->>CH: "Check test coverage"
    CH->>IN: run_inspector({scope: "test coverage", ...})
    IN-->>CH: InspectionReport
    CH-->>U: "Coverage is 42%. Inspector recommends..."
```

### 4.5 Context Compaction

Applies to **all agents** when their conversation approaches the context window limit.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Conversation<br/>history grows"] --> B{"Token usage<br/>> 80%?"}
    B -->|No| C["Continue normally"]
    B -->|Yes| D["Generate summary<br/>(LLM call)"]
    D --> E["Replace history with:<br/>[system_prompt, summary]"]
    E --> F["Agent re-reads<br/>disk state"]
    F --> C
    
    G{"Compacted<br/>3 times?"}
    B -->|Yes| G
    G -->|Yes| H["Terminate agent<br/>as stuck"]
    G -->|No| D
```

**Safety net order:** self-check (N rounds) → compaction (80% context) → max compactions (3) → forced termination.

---

## 5. MCP Services

The system interacts with external resources (filesystem, git, web) and manages internal state (plan, skills, memory) through **MCP services** — child processes that expose tools via the MCP SDK stdio protocol.

### 5.1 Service Overview

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Agent Process"
        AGENTS["Agents<br/>(Planner, Manager, Workers, Chat)"]
        MCPRT["MCP Runtime<br/><i>lazy start, health check,<br/>idle shutdown</i>"]
    end

    subgraph "MCP Services (child processes)"
        FS["Filesystem<br/><i>read, write, list, search</i>"]
        SH["Shell<br/><i>run_command</i>"]
        GIT["Git<br/><i>commit, status, diff, log</i><br/><b>serialized access</b>"]
        WEB["Web<br/><i>fetch_url, fetch_page_content</i>"]
        PLAN["Plan<br/><i>11 tools for plan CRUD</i><br/><b>atomic writes</b>"]
        SK["Skills<br/><i>list, read, create, update</i>"]
        MEM["Memory<br/><i>store, recall, list, delete</i><br/><b>SQLite + FTS5</b>"]
        IDX["Index<br/><i>ingest, search</i><br/><b>SQLite + FTS5</b>"]
    end

    AGENTS --> MCPRT
    MCPRT --> FS & SH & GIT & WEB & PLAN & SK & MEM & IDX
```

**Key design decisions:**
- **Git is serialized**: the Git MCP processes one tool call at a time. This eliminates race conditions — no locking needed.
- **Plan is atomic**: all plan writes use temp-file + rename. Schema validation on every write.
- **Services are lazy**: started on first tool call, shut down after idle timeout.
- **Generated services**: agents can create new MCP services at runtime using the v1 scaffold system, for project-specific tooling.

## 6. Concurrency Model

### 6.1 Single-Threaded Async

Saivage runs on the **Node.js single-threaded event loop**. All concurrency is cooperative async I/O:

- **LLM API calls**: the main source of async work. While waiting for one agent's response, another agent's response can arrive.
- **MCP tool calls**: child process communication via stdio pipes is async.
- **Channel messages**: Telegram polling and WebSocket events are async.

### 6.2 Active Agent Tree

At any point in time, only **leaf agents** are actively making LLM calls. Parent agents are suspended in memory.

```mermaid
graph TB
    RT["Runtime"] --> PL["Planner<br/><i>SUSPENDED</i>"]
    PL --> MG["Manager<br/><i>SUSPENDED</i>"]
    MG --> CD["Coder<br/><i>RUNNING</i>"]
    MG --> RS["Researcher<br/><i>RUNNING</i>"]
    RT --> CT["Chat:telegram<br/><i>RUNNING</i>"]
    RT --> CW["Chat:web<br/><i>RUNNING</i>"]
    
    style CD fill:#4a4,color:#fff
    style RS fill:#4a4,color:#fff
    style CT fill:#4a4,color:#fff
    style CW fill:#4a4,color:#fff
    style PL fill:#888,color:#fff
    style MG fill:#888,color:#fff
```

### 6.3 Race Condition Prevention

| Shared resource | Protection mechanism |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Git repository | Serialized through Git MCP (one call at a time) |
| plan.json | Serialized through Plan MCP (one call at a time) |
| File writes | Atomic temp-file + rename |
| Agent territories | Convention-based (Coder=project code, Researcher=research/) |

The **1 Coder + 1 Researcher** limit is enforced by the runtime, not just by convention. If the LLM emits duplicate dispatch calls of the same type, the excess calls are rejected.

## 7. Persistence & Recovery

### 7.1 Crash Recovery

On process restart, the system reconstructs its position from disk:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START["Process starts"] --> READ["Read runtime.json"]
    READ --> PID{"PID alive?"}
    PID -->|"Yes"| REFUSE["Another instance running<br/>Exit with error"]
    PID -->|"No / stale"| PLAN["Read plan.json via MCP"]
    PLAN --> STAGE{"current_stage_id<br/>set?"}
    STAGE -->|"No"| FRESH["Fresh start"]
    STAGE -->|"Yes"| SUMMARY{"summary.json<br/>exists?"}
    SUMMARY -->|"Yes"| PROCESS["Stage completed<br/>Planner processes it"]
    SUMMARY -->|"No"| TASKS{"tasks.json<br/>exists?"}
    TASKS -->|"Yes"| RESET["Reset in-progress & aborted<br/>tasks to pending"]
    TASKS -->|"No"| REDISPATCH["Planner re-dispatches stage"]
    
    RESET --> CHECK["Check for orphaned<br/>report files"]
    CHECK --> PLANNER["Start Planner as<br/>fresh conversation"]
    FRESH --> PLANNER
    PROCESS --> PLANNER
    REDISPATCH --> PLANNER
    PLANNER --> RECONSTRUCT["Planner calls plan_get()<br/>+ plan_get_history()"]
    RECONSTRUCT --> RESUME["Normal execution"]
```

### 7.2 What Survives a Crash

| State | Survives? | How |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Plan (stages, history) | ✓ | plan.json, plan-history.json on disk |
| Task list and status | ✓ | tasks.json on disk |
| Task reports | ✓ | reports/<task-id>.json on disk |
| Stage summaries | ✓ | summary.json on disk |
| Inspection reports | ✓ | inspections/<id>.json on disk |
| Git commits | ✓ | Git history |
| Uncommitted file changes | ✓ | Working tree (unless aborted) |
| Agent conversations | ✗ | In-memory only. Reconstructed from disk. |
| Event bus state | ✗ | In-memory only. Events re-publish on reconnection. |

## 8. Deployment

### 8.1 Runtime Environment

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "LXC Container: saivage (10.0.3.111)"
        subgraph "Node.js Process"
            CORE["Runtime Core"]
            AGENTS["Agent Conversations"]
            WS["WebSocket :7777"]
            EBUS["Event Bus"]
        end
        subgraph "MCP Child Processes"
            FS["filesystem"] & SH["shell"] & GIT["git"] & WEB["web"]
            PLAN["plan"] & SK["skills"] & MEM["memory"] & IDX["index"]
        end
        GLOBAL["~/.saivage/<br/>config, auth, data"]
        PROJECT["/home/salva/&lt;project&gt;/.saivage/<br/>plan, stages, reports"]
    end

    TG_API["Telegram API"] <-.->|"outbound"| CORE
    LLM_API["LLM Provider APIs"] <-.->|"outbound"| CORE
```

### 8.2 Configuration

**Two-tier configuration:**

- **Global** (`~/.saivage/config.json`): LLM provider credentials (API keys, model assignments per role, timeout, failover), Telegram bot token and user ID, auth directory. Shared across all projects.
- **Per-project** (`<project>/.saivage/config.json`): project name and objectives, provider selection, model overrides, notification preferences (channels, severity filters, category filters), skill loading budget, per-agent tuning (compaction threshold, self-check frequency, max compactions).

Full schema in [01-DATA-MODEL.md](01-DATA-MODEL.md) §1-2.

### 8.3 Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build               # TypeScript → dist/
make -C deploy deploy       # rsync + npm ci + build + systemctl restart
```

### 8.4 CLI

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `init <project-path>` | Initialize `.saivage/` directory structure |
| `start <project-path>` | Start the execution loop |
| `status <project-path>` | Show current plan, stage, tasks |
| `note <project-path> <msg>` | Create a user note directly |
| `inspect <project-path> <scope>` | Dispatch Inspector from CLI |
| `login` | Authenticate with LLM provider |
| `config` | Manage global configuration |

## 9. Safety & Reliability

### 9.1 Defense in Depth

Multiple layers prevent runaway agents, data corruption, and unrecoverable failures:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Layer 1: Agent Self-Governance"
        SC["Self-Check<br/><i>Every N tool-call rounds,<br/>agent assesses own progress</i>"]
    end
    subgraph "Layer 2: Runtime Guardrails"
        COMP["Context Compaction<br/><i>At 80% context window,<br/>summarize and continue</i>"]
        MAXC["Max Compactions<br/><i>3 compactions per conversation<br/>→ forced termination</i>"]
    end
    subgraph "Layer 3: Task-Level Controls"
        RETRY["Task max_attempts<br/><i>2-3 retries before escalation</i>"]
    end
    subgraph "Layer 4: Hierarchy"
        ESC["Escalation Chain<br/><i>Worker → Manager → Planner → User</i>"]
    end
    subgraph "Layer 5: User Control"
        ABORT["Abort<br/><i>User can force-stop and redirect</i>"]
    end

    SC --> COMP --> MAXC --> RETRY --> ESC --> ABORT
```

### 9.2 Fault Tolerance

| Failure | Recovery mechanism |
|---------|-------------------|
| LLM API timeout / 5xx | Exponential backoff, unlimited retries |
| LLM API 400 (bad request) | Agent returns failure to parent |
| LLM provider persistently down | Failover to backup provider |
| Invalid tool call from LLM | Error result returned to LLM (self-corrects); 3 consecutive failures → agent failure |
| MCP service crash | Auto-restart on next tool call |
| Agent infinite loop | Self-check → compaction → max compactions → forced termination |
| Process crash | Disk-based recovery on restart |
| User abort | `git checkout -- .`, rollback stage, replan |
| Git conflict | Agent reports failure; Manager creates resolution task or escalates |

### 9.3 Auditability

Every agent action produces a persistent, git-committed artifact:

- **Planner**: `plan.json`, `plan-history.json` (committed via `plan_commit()`)
- **Manager**: `tasks.json`, `summary.json` (committed via git MCP)
- **Workers**: task reports + git commits with `[tsk-<id>]` prefix
- **Inspector**: `inspections/<id>.json` + tools under `tools/inspector/`
- **Chat**: dialogue logs in `tmp/chats/` (ephemeral but persisted across sessions)

The git log provides a complete, append-only timeline of all changes.

### 10.1 What Changes

| Aspect | v1 | v2 |
|--------|----|----|
| **Architecture** | Flat orchestrator + agents | Hierarchical: Planner → Manager → Workers |

| **Concurrency** | Sequential tasks only | 1 Coder + 1 Researcher in parallel |
| **State management** | In-memory + orchestrator | Disk-authoritative, crash-recoverable |
| **Git access** | Direct CLI | MCP-serialized, explicit file staging |
