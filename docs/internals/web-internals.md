# Web Dashboard Internals

[`web/`](https://github.com/salva/saivage/tree/main/web)

The dashboard is a small Vue 3 + Vite single-page application. It is
served as static assets by the daemon; all runtime data flows through
the REST endpoints + WebSocket described in [Web Dashboard](/guide/web-ui).

## Stack

- Vue 3 (composition API, `<script setup>`).
- Vite for build & dev server.
- `lucide-vue-next` for icons.
- Plain CSS (`web/src/styles.css`); no UI framework.

## Component map

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `App.vue` | Top-level layout, panel switcher. |
| `components/PlanView.vue` | Active plan + history visualization. |
| `components/AgentsView.vue` | Live agent list and conversation viewer. |
| `components/ChatWindow.vue` | WebSocket chat against the Chat agent. |
| `components/StatusPanel.vue` | Daemon status header. |
| `components/FilesView.vue` | Read-only project file browser. |
| `components/DebugView.vue` | `/api/debug/*` outputs for diagnosis. |
| `components/JsonHighlight.vue` | Pretty JSON printer. |
| `components/FormattedContent.vue` | Markdown / code block renderer. |

## State management

The app holds state in the root `App.vue` and a single composable
`composables/useWebSocket.ts` owning the WebSocket connection,
reconnection backoff, and the inbound JSON parser. There is no Pinia or
Vuex — the surface is small enough.

## Build

```bash
npm run build:web        # one-shot
npm --prefix web run dev # dev server with HMR
```

In dev, configure Vite's `proxy` to forward `/api` and `/ws` to the
daemon (the Saivage repo's `web/vite.config.ts` already does this for
`localhost:8080`).

## Output

`vite build` writes to `web/dist/`. The Fastify server serves this
directory at `/`. Saivage's outer `npm run build` calls `npm run build:web`
before bundling the server with tsup.

## Customizing

- Branding: edit `App.vue` header and `index.html`.
- Theming: `styles.css` exposes CSS variables for colors / spacing.
- New panel: add a Vue component, register it in `App.vue`'s panel
  switcher, and wire any new REST/WS calls through `useWebSocket.ts`.

## Known constraints

- No authentication. The dashboard assumes a trusted network.
- No SSR. The bundle is purely client-side; the HTML shell is static.
- WebSocket reconnect is bounded backoff (1 s → 30 s) without state
  resync — heavy reconnect loops will lose interim events.
